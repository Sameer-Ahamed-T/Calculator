# ðŸ§® Command-Line Calculator in Java

## ðŸš€ Overview
This is a simple command-line calculator built using Java that performs basic arithmetic operations. It allows users to chain calculations interactively until they decide to quit.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulo (`%`)
- Expression display with intermediate result
- Graceful exit using the `q` key

## ðŸ’» How It Works
- Users input numbers and operators one by one.
- The calculator maintains the result and updates it after each operation.
- Pressing `=` shows the current calculation and result.
- Enter `q` after `=` to quit or continue with another operator.

## ðŸ“‹ Sample Usage
```plaintext
Input: 10 + 5 =  
Output: 10+5 = 15  
Input: - 3 =  
Output: 15-3 = 12  
Input: q  
Program exits.
```

## ðŸ§  Notes
- The program uses Java's `Scanner` class to read user inputs.
- Any unexpected character after `=` will terminate the session with an error message.

## ðŸ›  How to Run
1. Save the code in a file named `Calculator.java`
2. Open terminal and compile:
   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   java Calculator
   ```
